<h3>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
<p>
The first thing that stood out when I entered the Luni website was its clean, minimalist aesthetic combined with high-quality visuals and smooth animations. The landing page Luniverse draws attention with its bold typography and colour scheme, giving a creative and modern vibe. To add on, the animations of the race car was very smooth, giving the experience a very aesthetic feel. The simplicity made the interface approachable while still suggesting a deeper story waiting to be explored—especially the header sections like Studio and Omada, which seemed to promise insight into Lunis innovative projects.
</p>

<p>
  Within two minutes, I noticed that the website had many interesting interactive elements. When I first landed on the main page, I clicked on animations such as the notebook to test the interactive feedback. Furthermore, the four animations on the main page could be transitioned into four different sections, including: Omanda, Studio, Career and Luni Life.  
I first scrolled down the homepage to get an overview of the brand. Then I clicked on the menu bar to explore Lunis portfolio, followed by the “Omada” section to understand one of their highlighted apps. I hovered over animations and images to test the interactive feedback and transitioned into the “Career” section to read about job opportunities. I also visited “Luni Life” to get a feel for their internal culture and values. Lastly, I briefly examined the footer for links to their social channels and legal information. 
</p>

<p>The section I spent the most time with was the “Omada” project page. It is visually distinct and highlights one of their newest and most socially engaging applications—a prediction-based app that mimics the excitement of betting without the risks of real money. It cleverly blends game design with community interaction, and I found myself reading carefully to understand how Luni integrates technology like chat functions through PubNub. The way Omada was framed as a playful, low-stakes social experience was especially compelling. </p>
