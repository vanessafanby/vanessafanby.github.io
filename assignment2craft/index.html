            <li>Choose a square piece of colored or patterned paper.</li>
            <li>Use a ruler to find and mark the center by drawing diagonals, corner to corner.</li>
            <li>Make a small hole in the center where the diagonals cross.</li>
            <li>Use scissors to cut along each diagonal, about halfway to the middle of the paper. Be sure not to cut all the way.</li>
            <li>You should now have 4 triangle flaps still connected at the center.</li>
            <li>Choose one corner of each triangle flap (always the left corner) and gently fold that corner towards the center.</li>
            <li>Hold each folded corner at the center with a glue dot, one at a time.</li>
            <li>After folding all 4 corners to the center, press them down with a glue dot.</li>
            <li>Use a pipe cleaner to poke through the center of the windmill.</li>
            <li>Then, wrap and twist the other end of the pipe cleaner around the top of the paper straw, leaving it a bit loose so the windmill can spin.</li>
            <li>Well done! You have made a windmill!</li>
